# Problem statement
Studying interactions between species is an important part of Biology. These interactions can range from eating each other, helping each other (for example by pollination) or infecting each other.
Being able to quickly find species interactions would certainly help in research, especially biology students who dont want to go through a lot of papers to discover these interactions.

# Solution
The solution would be a simple app, in which you can search for species or interaction, and show the interaction as well as more information on the species associated with the interaction.
